# Home Goods R Us


This application is developed by Andri Alexandrou, Carmen Vazquez-Marin, and Mike Ulvila.

We are working on application #2, in which we are operating a home goods store that allows users to toggle between seasonal discounts that happen in Autumn, Winter, and Spring. 

Product information is loaded from one JSON file, listing product name, price, and category-id, given a numeric value per department.

Discount information is loaded from the second JSON file, listing department name matching the numeric department value (corresponding to category-id in first JSON file), season, and store-wide discount.

The purpose of the page is to apply the seasonal discounts on user click interacting with dropdown to the store-wide prices.

On Monday

+	Complete HBS template, using proper implementation of {{#if}} statements,
+	Get AJAX and callback functions to work properly,
+	Paint page uniting information from JSON and HBS,
+	Apply store-wide discounts on user toggle of dropdown in navbar.
